# Hitster Card Generator

This project generates custom cards for the game **Hitster**, where each card contains:

- The song title  
- The artist  
- The release year  
- A QR code linking directly to the song on Spotify

The songs are pulled from a public Spotify playlist using the Spotify Web API.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

Please create a folder named `images_output` in the main project directory. This is where the generated card images will be saved when you run the script.

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

Download the project files to your computer.

### 2. Create a `.env` File

In the project root, create a file named `.env` and add your Spotify API credentials.

🔒 **Important**: `.env` files are used to store sensitive information like API keys and passwords. This file is automatically hidden by many systems and should never be committed to version control (e.g., GitHub).

```
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id  
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
```

To get these credentials:

1. Visit the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
2. Log in with your Spotify account.
3. Click **"Create an App"**, give it a name and description.
4. After creating the app, you will find your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
5. Copy those into your `.env` file as shown above.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed. Then open a terminal in the project folder (preferably in Visual Studio Code) and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary packages like Spotipy, qrcode, Pillow, etc. I have listed them all in one `requirements.txt` file so that you can automatically install the correct versions in one go.

## ▶️ Running the Script

This will fetch the songs from the hardcoded Spotify playlist and generate styled image cards:

```bash
python generate_cards.py
```

Each card will be saved as a PNG in the `images_output` folder.

💡 Make sure the playlist link used in the script is valid.  
To get the correct link, right-click a playlist in Spotify → Share → **Copy link to playlist** (not the embed code). Then update the `playlist_link` variable in `generate_cards.py`.

---

## 📝 Customisation

- **To change the playlist**: edit the `playlist_link` in `generate_cards.py`  
- **To adjust colours or layout**: update the relevant lists and values at the top of `generate_cards.py`  
- **To change the font**: double-click the included font file (e.g., `openSans.ttf`) to install it on your system.  
  If you prefer to use another font or if the file is missing, update the `font_path` variable in the script accordingly.

## 📁 Output Example

Each generated card includes:

- Title and artist (with auto-wrapping)  
- Release year  
- Custom-coloured QR code linking to the track  

Cards are styled in batches of 20 with consistent colour themes.
